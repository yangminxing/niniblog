# niniblog
JDK 1.8
Niniblog is a easy blog. It mainly servers for someone who wants to
share their software programming experience.

Some tips:

In this blog, you could ask specific questions to pointed blogger instead
of asking in some QA websites like a stone dropped into the sea.

The articles in this blog could be copy to anywhere. You know its really
hard to keep copy behavior away, so I agree with that. Hence the blog will
record the article's published datetime and updated datetime.

In the other hand, we don't recommend that copy articles from another.
When you publishing articles, the program will try to check the word to
prevent reduplicative articles.

Finally I have not finish it. I am working on it!
